 SQL Library Manager

Created an application for my local library to help them manage their collection of books. The librarian has been using a simple SQLite database and has been entering data in manually, which can become cumbersome. The librarian wants a more intuitive way to manage the library's collection of books.

In this project, I built a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books. There are HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. I implemented a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
